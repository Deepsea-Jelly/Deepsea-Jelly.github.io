I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I\u0026rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won\u0026rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template. Then we\u0026rsquo;ll add in a few pages and posts. With small variations on that, you will be able to create many different types of web sites.\nIn this tutorial, commands that you enter will start with the \u0026ldquo;$\u0026rdquo; prompt. The output will follow. Lines that start with \u0026ldquo;#\u0026rdquo; are comments that I\u0026rsquo;ve added to explain a point. When I show updates to a file, the \u0026ldquo;:wq\u0026rdquo; on the last line means to save the file.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an example:\n## this is a comment $ echo this is a command this is a command ## edit the file $ vi foo.md +++ date = \u0026#34;2014-09-28\u0026#34; title = \u0026#34;creating a new theme\u0026#34; +++ bah and humbug :wq ## show it $ cat foo.md +++ date = \u0026#34;2014-09-28\u0026#34; title = \u0026#34;creating a new theme\u0026#34; +++ bah and humbug $ Some Definitions #  There are a few concepts that you need to understand before creating a theme.\nSkins #  Skins are the files responsible for the look and feel of your site. It’s the CSS that controls colors and fonts, it’s the Javascript that determines actions and reactions. It’s also the rules that Hugo uses to transform your content into the HTML that the site will serve to visitors.\nYou have two ways to create a skin. The simplest way is to create it in the layouts/ directory. If you do, then you don’t have to worry about configuring Hugo to recognize it. The first place that Hugo will look for rules and files is in the layouts/ directory so it will always find the skin.\nYour second choice is to create it in a sub-directory of the themes/ directory. If you do, then you must always tell Hugo where to search for the skin. It’s extra work, though, so why bother with it?\nThe difference between creating a skin in layouts/ and creating it in themes/ is very subtle. A skin in layouts/ can’t be customized without updating the templates and static files that it is built from. A skin created in themes/, on the other hand, can be and that makes it easier for other people to use it.\nThe rest of this tutorial will call a skin created in the themes/ directory a theme.\nNote that you can use this tutorial to create a skin in the layouts/ directory if you wish to. The main difference will be that you won’t need to update the site’s configuration file to use a theme.\nThe Home Page #  The home page, or landing page, is the first page that many visitors to a site see. It is the index.html file in the root directory of the web site. Since Hugo writes files to the public/ directory, our home page is public/index.html.\nSite Configuration File #  When Hugo runs, it looks for a configuration file that contains settings that override default values for the entire site. The file can use TOML, YAML, or JSON. I prefer to use TOML for my configuration files. If you prefer to use JSON or YAML, you’ll need to translate my examples. You’ll also need to change the name of the file since Hugo uses the extension to determine how to process it.\nHugo translates Markdown files into HTML. By default, Hugo expects to find Markdown files in your content/ directory and template files in your themes/ directory. It will create HTML files in your public/ directory. You can change this by specifying alternate locations in the configuration file.\nContent #  Content is stored in text files that contain two sections. The first section is the “front matter,” which is the meta-information on the content. The second section contains Markdown that will be converted to HTML.\nFront Matter #  The front matter is information about the content. Like the configuration file, it can be written in TOML, YAML, or JSON. Unlike the configuration file, Hugo doesn’t use the file’s extension to know the format. It looks for markers to signal the type. TOML is surrounded by “+++”, YAML by “---”, and JSON is enclosed in curly braces. I prefer to use TOML, so you’ll need to translate my examples if you prefer YAML or JSON.\nThe information in the front matter is passed into the template before the content is rendered into HTML.\nMarkdown #  Content is written in Markdown which makes it easier to create the content. Hugo runs the content through a Markdown engine to create the HTML which will be written to the output file.\nTemplate Files #  Hugo uses template files to render content into HTML. Template files are a bridge between the content and presentation. Rules in the template define what content is published, where it\u0026rsquo;s published to, and how it will rendered to the HTML file. The template guides the presentation by specifying the style to use.\nThere are three types of templates: single, list, and partial. Each type takes a bit of content as input and transforms it based on the commands in the template.\nHugo uses its knowledge of the content to find the template file used to render the content. If it can’t find a template that is an exact match for the content, it will shift up a level and search from there. It will continue to do so until it finds a matching template or runs out of templates to try. If it can’t find a template, it will use the default template for the site.\nPlease note that you can use the front matter to influence Hugo’s choice of templates.\nSingle Template #  A single template is used to render a single piece of content. For example, an article or post would be a single piece of content and use a single template.\nList Template #  A list template renders a group of related content. That could be a summary of recent postings or all articles in a category. List templates can contain multiple groups.\nThe homepage template is a special type of list template. Hugo assumes that the home page of your site will act as the portal for the rest of the content in the site.\nPartial Template #  A partial template is a template that can be included in other templates. Partial templates must be called using the “partial” template command. They are very handy for rolling up common behavior. For example, your site may have a banner that all pages use. Instead of copying the text of the banner into every single and list template, you could create a partial with the banner in it. That way if you decide to change the banner, you only have to change the partial template.\nCreate a New Site #  Let\u0026rsquo;s use Hugo to create a new web site. I\u0026rsquo;m a Mac user, so I\u0026rsquo;ll create mine in my home directory, in the Sites folder. If you\u0026rsquo;re using Linux, you might have to create the folder first.\nThe \u0026ldquo;new site\u0026rdquo; command will create a skeleton of a site. It will give you the basic directory structure and a useable configuration file.\n$ hugo new site ~/Sites/zafta $ cd ~/Sites/zafta $ ls -l total 8 drwxr-xr-x 7 quoha staff 238 Sep 29 16:49 . drwxr-xr-x 3 quoha staff 102 Sep 29 16:49 .. drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 archetypes -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 82 Sep 29 16:49 config.toml drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 content drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 layouts drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 static $ Take a look in the content/ directory to confirm that it is empty.\nThe other directories (archetypes/, layouts/, and static/) are used when customizing a theme. That\u0026rsquo;s a topic for a different tutorial, so please ignore them for now.\nGenerate the HTML For the New Site #  Running the hugo command with no options will read all the available content and generate the HTML files. It will also copy all static files (that\u0026rsquo;s everything that\u0026rsquo;s not content). Since we have an empty site, it won\u0026rsquo;t do much, but it will do it very quickly.\n$ hugo --verbose INFO: 2014/09/29 Using config file: config.toml INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [index.html _default/list.html _default/single.html] WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [404.html] 0 draft content 0 future content 0 pages created 0 tags created 0 categories created in 2 ms $ The \u0026ldquo;--verbose\u0026rdquo; flag gives extra information that will be helpful when we build the template. Every line of the output that starts with \u0026ldquo;INFO:\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;WARN:\u0026rdquo; is present because we used that flag. The lines that start with \u0026ldquo;WARN:\u0026rdquo; are warning messages. We\u0026rsquo;ll go over them later.\nWe can verify that the command worked by looking at the directory again.\n$ ls -l total 8 drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 archetypes -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 82 Sep 29 16:49 config.toml drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 content drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 layouts drwxr-xr-x 4 quoha staff 136 Sep 29 17:02 public drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 static $ See that new public/ directory? Hugo placed all generated content there. When you\u0026rsquo;re ready to publish your web site, that\u0026rsquo;s the place to start.

It will dramatically shorten your development cycle if you do. Start it by running the \u0026ldquo;server\u0026rdquo; command. If it is successful, you will see output similar to the following:\n$ hugo server --verbose INFO: 2014/09/29 Using config file: /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/config.toml INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [index.html _default/list.html _default/single.html] WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [404.html] 0 draft content 0 future content 0 pages created 0 tags created 0 categories created in 2 ms Serving pages from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public Web Server is available at http://localhost:1313 Press Ctrl+C to stop Connect to the listed URL (it\u0026rsquo;s on the line that starts with \u0026ldquo;Web Server\u0026rdquo;). If everything is working correctly, you should get a page that shows the following:\nindex.xml sitemap.xml That\u0026rsquo;s a listing of your public/ directory. Hugo didn\u0026rsquo;t create a home page because our site has no content. When there\u0026rsquo;s no index.html file in a directory, the server lists the files in the directory, which is what you should see in your browser.\nLet’s go back and look at those warnings again.\nWARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [index.html _default/list.html _default/single.html] WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [404.html] That second warning is easier to explain. We haven’t created a template to be used to generate “page not found errors.” The 404 message is a topic for a separate tutorial.\nNow for the first warning. It is for the home page. You can tell because the first layout that it looked for was “index.html.” That’s only used by the home page.\nI like that the verbose flag causes Hugo to list the files that it\u0026rsquo;s searching for. For the home page, they are index.html, _default/list.html, and _default/single.html. There are some rules that we\u0026rsquo;ll cover later that explain the names and paths. For now, just remember that Hugo couldn\u0026rsquo;t find a template for the home page and it told you so.\nAt this point, you\u0026rsquo;ve got a working installation and site that we can build upon. All that’s left is to add some content and a theme to display it.\nCreate a New Theme #  Hugo doesn\u0026rsquo;t ship with a default theme. There are a few available (I counted a dozen when I first installed Hugo) and Hugo comes with a command to create new themes.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re going to create a new theme called \u0026ldquo;zafta.\u0026rdquo; Since the goal of this tutorial is to show you how to fill out the files to pull in your content, the theme will not contain any CSS. In other words, ugly but functional.\nAll themes have opinions on content and layout. For example, Zafta uses \u0026ldquo;post\u0026rdquo; over \u0026ldquo;blog\u0026rdquo;. Strong opinions make for simpler templates but differing opinions make it tougher to use themes. When you build a theme, consider using the terms that other themes do.\nCreate a Skeleton #  Use the hugo \u0026ldquo;new\u0026rdquo; command to create the skeleton of a theme. This creates the directory structure and places empty files for you to fill out.\n$ hugo new theme zafta $ ls -l total 8 drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 archetypes -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 82 Sep 29 16:49 config.toml drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 content drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 layouts drwxr-xr-x 4 quoha staff 136 Sep 29 17:02 public drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 static drwxr-xr-x 3 quoha staff 102 Sep 29 17:31 themes $ find themes -type f | xargs ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 1081 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/LICENSE.md -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/archetypes/default.md -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/_default/list.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/_default/single.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/partials/footer.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/partials/header.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 93 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/theme.toml $ The skeleton includes templates (the files ending in .html), license file, a description of your theme (the theme.toml file), and an empty archetype.\nPlease take a minute to fill out the theme.toml and LICENSE.md files.

It doesn\u0026rsquo;t count things like the index.html files that it creates automatically.  The Home Page #  Hugo supports many different types of templates. The home page is special because it gets its own type of template and its own template file. The file, layouts/index.html, is used to generate the HTML for the home page. The Hugo documentation says that this is the only required template, but that depends. Hugo\u0026rsquo;s warning message shows that it looks for three different templates:\nWARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [index.html _default/list.html _default/single.html] If it can\u0026rsquo;t find any of these, it completely skips creating the home page. We noticed that when we built the site without having a theme installed.\nWhen Hugo created our theme, it created an empty home page template. Now, when we build the site, Hugo finds the template and uses it to generate the HTML for the home page. Since the template file is empty, the HTML file is empty, too. If the template had any rules in it, then Hugo would have used them to generate the home page.\n$ find . -name index.html | xargs ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 20:21 ./public/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 ./themes/zafta/layouts/index.html $ The Magic of Static #  Hugo does two things when generating the site. It uses templates to transform content into HTML and it copies static files into the site. Unlike content, static files are not transformed. They are copied exactly as they are.\nHugo assumes that your site will use both CSS and JavaScript, so it creates directories in your theme to hold them. Remember opinions? Well, Hugo\u0026rsquo;s opinion is that you\u0026rsquo;ll store your CSS in a directory named css/ and your JavaScript in a directory named js/. If you don\u0026rsquo;t like that, you can change the directory names in your theme directory or even delete them completely. Hugo\u0026rsquo;s nice enough to offer its opinion, then behave nicely if you disagree.\n$ find themes/zafta -type d | xargs ls -ld drwxr-xr-x 7 quoha staff 238 Sep 29 17:38 themes/zafta drwxr-xr-x 3 quoha staff 102 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/archetypes drwxr-xr-x 5 quoha staff 170 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts drwxr-xr-x 4 quoha staff 136 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/_default drwxr-xr-x 4 quoha staff 136 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/partials drwxr-xr-x 4 quoha staff 136 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/static drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/static/css drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/static/js $ The Theme Development Cycle #  When you\u0026rsquo;re working on a theme, you will make changes in the theme\u0026rsquo;s directory, rebuild the site, and check your changes in the browser. Hugo makes this very easy:\n Purge the public/ directory. Run the built in web server in watch mode. Open your site in a browser. Update the theme. Glance at your browser window to see changes. Return to step 4.  I’ll throw in one more opinion: never work on a theme on a live site. Always work on a copy of your site. Make changes to your theme, test them, then copy them up to your site. For added safety, use a tool like Git to keep a revision history of your content and your theme. Believe me when I say that it is too easy to lose both your mind and your changes.\nCheck the main Hugo site for information on using Git with Hugo.\nPurge the public/ Directory #  When generating the site, Hugo will create new files and update existing ones in the public/ directory. It will not delete files that are no longer used. For example, files that were created in the wrong directory or with the wrong title will remain. If you leave them, you might get confused by them later. I recommend cleaning out your site prior to generating it.\nNote: If you\u0026rsquo;re building on an SSD, you should ignore this. Churning on a SSD can be costly.\nHugo\u0026rsquo;s Watch Option #  Hugo\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;--watch\u0026rdquo; option will monitor the content/ and your theme directories for changes and rebuild the site automatically.\nLive Reload #  Hugo\u0026rsquo;s built in web server supports live reload.

We also have \u0026ldquo;list\u0026rdquo; templates that are used to group multiple pieces of content before generating output.\nGenerally speaking, list templates are named \u0026ldquo;list.html\u0026rdquo; and single templates are named \u0026ldquo;single.html.\u0026rdquo;\nThere are three other types of templates: partials, content views, and terms. We will not go into much detail on these.\nAdd Content to the Homepage #  The home page will contain a list of posts. Let\u0026rsquo;s update its template to add the posts that we just created.

That engine scans the template files for commands which are enclosed between \u0026ldquo;{{\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;}}\u0026rdquo;. In our template, the commands are:\n range .Title end  The \u0026ldquo;range\u0026rdquo; command is an iterator. We\u0026rsquo;re going to use it to go through the first ten pages. Every HTML file that Hugo creates is treated as a page, so looping through the list of pages will look at every file that will be created.\nThe \u0026ldquo;.Title\u0026rdquo; command prints the value of the \u0026ldquo;title\u0026rdquo; variable. Hugo pulls it from the front matter in the Markdown file.\nThe \u0026ldquo;end\u0026rdquo; command signals the end of the range iterator. The engine loops back to the top of the iteration when it finds \u0026ldquo;end.\u0026rdquo; Everything between the \u0026ldquo;range\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;end\u0026rdquo; is evaluated every time the engine goes through the iteration. In this file, that would cause the title from the first ten pages to be output as heading level one.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s helpful to remember that some variables, like .Data, are created before any output files. Hugo loads every content file into the variable and then gives the template a chance to process before creating the HTML files.\nBuild the web site and then verify the results.\n$ rm -rf public $ hugo --verbose INFO: 2014/09/29 Using config file: /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/config.toml INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/themes/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ INFO: 2014/09/29 found taxonomies: map[string]string{\u0026#34;tag\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;tags\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;category\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;categories\u0026#34;} WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [404.html theme/404.html] 0 draft content 0 future content 2 pages created 0 tags created 0 categories created in 4 ms $ find public -type f -name \u0026#39;*.html\u0026#39; | xargs ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 94 Sep 29 22:23 public/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 22:23 public/post/first/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 22:23 public/post/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 22:23 public/post/second/index.html $ cat public/index.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;second\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;first\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; $ Congratulations, the home page shows the title of the two posts. The posts themselves are still empty, but let\u0026rsquo;s take a moment to appreciate what we\u0026rsquo;ve done. Your template now generates output dynamically. Believe it or not, by inserting the range command inside of those curly braces, you\u0026rsquo;ve learned everything you need to know to build a theme. All that\u0026rsquo;s really left is understanding which template will be used to generate each content file and becoming familiar with the commands for the template engine.\nAnd, if that were entirely true, this tutorial would be much shorter. There are a few things to know that will make creating a new template much easier. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, though, that\u0026rsquo;s all to come.\nAdd Content to the Posts #  We\u0026rsquo;re working with posts, which are in the content/post/ directory. That means that their section is \u0026ldquo;post\u0026rdquo; (and if we don\u0026rsquo;t do something weird, their type is also \u0026ldquo;post\u0026rdquo;).\nHugo uses the section and type to find the template file for every piece of content. Hugo will first look for a template file that matches the section or type name. If it can\u0026rsquo;t find one, then it will look in the _default/ directory. There are some twists that we\u0026rsquo;ll cover when we get to categories and tags, but for now we can assume that Hugo will try post/single.html, then _default/single.html.\nNow that we know the search rule, let\u0026rsquo;s see what we actually have available:\n$ find themes/zafta -name single.html | xargs ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 132 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/_default/single.html We could create a new template, post/single.html, or change the default. Since we don\u0026rsquo;t know of any other content types, let\u0026rsquo;s start with updating the default.\nRemember, any content that we haven\u0026rsquo;t created a template for will end up using this template. That can be good or bad. Bad because I know that we\u0026rsquo;re going to be adding different types of content and we\u0026rsquo;re going to end up undoing some of the changes we\u0026rsquo;ve made. It\u0026rsquo;s good because we\u0026rsquo;ll be able to see immediate results. It\u0026rsquo;s also good to start here because we can start to build the basic layout for the site. As we add more content types, we\u0026rsquo;ll refactor this file and move logic around. Hugo makes that fairly painless, so we\u0026rsquo;ll accept the cost and proceed.\nPlease see the Hugo documentation on template rendering for all the details on determining which template to use.

His actors, spurred on by him, had not ceased to spout his comedy, and he had not ceased to listen to it. He had made up his mind about the tumult, and was determined to proceed to the end, not giving up the hope of a return of attention on the part of the public. This gleam of hope acquired fresh life, when he saw Quasimodo, Coppenole, and the deafening escort of the pope of the procession of fools quit the hall amid great uproar. The throng rushed eagerly after them. “Good,” he said to himself, “there go all the mischief-makers.” Unfortunately, all the mischief-makers constituted the entire audience. In the twinkling of an eye, the grand hall was empty.\nTo tell the truth, a few spectators still remained, some scattered, others in groups around the pillars, women, old men, or children, who had had enough of the uproar and tumult. Some scholars were still perched astride of the window-sills, engaged in gazing into the Place.\n“Well,” thought Gringoire, “here are still as many as are required to hear the end of my mystery. They are few in number, but it is a choice audience, a lettered audience.”\nAn instant later, a symphony which had been intended to produce the greatest effect on the arrival of the Virgin, was lacking.

La Esmeralda in the Place!”\nThis word produced a magical effect. Every one who was left in the hall flew to the windows, climbing the walls in order to see, and repeating, “La Esmeralda! La Esmeralda?” At the same time, a great sound of applause was heard from without.\n“What’s the meaning of this, of the Esmeralda?” said Gringoire, wringing his hands in despair. “Ah, good heavens! it seems to be the turn of the windows now.”\nHe returned towards the marble table, and saw that the representation had been interrupted.

Bourgeois, scholars and law clerks all set to work. The little chapel situated opposite the marble table was selected for the scene of the grinning match. A pane broken in the pretty rose window above the door, left free a circle of stone through which it was agreed that the competitors should thrust their heads. In order to reach it, it was only necessary to mount upon a couple of hogsheads, which had been produced from I know not where, and perched one upon the other, after a fashion. It was settled that each candidate, man or woman (for it was possible to choose a female pope), should, for the sake of leaving the impression of his grimace fresh and complete, cover his face and remain concealed in the chapel until the moment of his appearance. In less than an instant, the chapel was crowded with competitors, upon whom the door was then closed.\nCoppenole, from his post, ordered all, directed all, arranged all. During the uproar, the cardinal, no less abashed than Gringoire, had retired with all his suite, under the pretext of business and vespers, without the crowd which his arrival had so deeply stirred being in the least moved by his departure. Guillaume Rym was the only one who noticed his eminence’s discomfiture. The attention of the populace, like the sun, pursued its revolution; having set out from one end of the hall, and halted for a space in the middle, it had now reached the other end. The marble table, the brocaded gallery had each had their day; it was now the turn of the chapel of Louis XI. Henceforth, the field was open to all folly. There was no one there now, but the Flemings and the rabble.\nThe grimaces began. The first face which appeared at the aperture, with eyelids turned up to the reds, a mouth open like a maw, and a brow wrinkled like our hussar boots of the Empire, evoked such an inextinguishable peal of laughter that Homer would have taken all these louts for gods. Nevertheless, the grand hall was anything but Olympus, and Gringoire’s poor Jupiter knew it better than any one else. A second and third grimace followed, then another and another; and the laughter and transports of delight went on increasing. There was in this spectacle, a peculiar power of intoxication and fascination, of which it would be difficult to convey to the reader of our day and our salons any idea.\nLet the reader picture to himself a series of visages presenting successively all geometrical forms, from the triangle to the trapezium, from the cone to the polyhedron; all human expressions, from wrath to lewdness; all ages, from the wrinkles of the new-born babe to the wrinkles of the aged and dying; all religious phantasmagories, from Faun to Beelzebub; all animal profiles, from the maw to the beak, from the jowl to the muzzle. Let the reader imagine all these grotesque figures of the Pont Neuf, those nightmares petrified beneath the hand of Germain Pilon, assuming life and breath, and coming in turn to stare you in the face with burning eyes; all the masks of the Carnival of Venice passing in succession before your glass,—in a word, a human kaleidoscope.\nThe orgy grew more and more Flemish. Teniers could have given but a very imperfect idea of it. Let the reader picture to himself in bacchanal form, Salvator Rosa’s battle. There were no longer either scholars or ambassadors or bourgeois or men or women; there was no longer any Clopin Trouillefou, nor Gilles Lecornu, nor Marie Quatrelivres, nor Robin Poussepain. All was universal license. The grand hall was no longer anything but a vast furnace of effrontry and joviality, where every mouth was a cry, every individual a posture; everything shouted and howled. The strange visages which came, in turn, to gnash their teeth in the rose window, were like so many brands cast into the brazier; and from the whole of this effervescing crowd, there escaped, as from a furnace, a sharp, piercing, stinging noise, hissing like the wings of a gnat.\n"},{"id":9,"href":"/zh/post/chapter-5/","title":"Chapter V: 长恨歌","section":"博文","content":"长恨歌 #  （唐）白居易 #  汉皇重色思倾国，御宇多年求不得。\n杨家有女初长成，养在深闺人未识。\n天生丽质难自弃，一朝选在君王侧。\n回眸一笑百媚生，六宫粉黛无颜色。\n春寒赐浴华清池，温泉水滑洗凝脂。\n侍儿扶起娇无力，始是新承恩泽时。\n云鬓花颜金步摇，芙蓉帐暖度春宵。\n春宵苦短日高起，从此君王不早朝。\n承欢侍宴无闲暇，春从春游夜专夜。\n后宫佳丽三千人，三千宠爱在一身。\n金屋妆成娇侍夜，玉楼宴罢醉和春。\n姊妹弟兄皆列土，可怜光采生门户。\n遂令天下父母心，不重生男重生女。\n骊宫高处入青云，仙乐风飘处处闻。\n缓歌慢舞凝丝竹，尽日君王看不足。\n渔阳鼙鼓动地来，惊破霓裳羽衣曲。\n九重城阙烟尘生，千乘万骑西南行。\n翠华摇摇行复止，西出都门百余里。\n六军不发无奈何，宛转蛾眉马前死。\n花钿委地无人收，翠翅金雀玉搔头。\n君王掩面救不得，回看血泪相和流。\n黄埃散漫风萧索，云栈萦纡登剑阁。\n峨嵋山下少人行，旌旗无光日色薄。\n蜀江水碧蜀山青，圣主朝朝暮暮情。\n行宫见月伤心色，夜雨闻铃肠断声。\n天旋地转回龙驭，到此踌躇不能去。\n马嵬坡下泥土中，不见玉颜空死处。\n君臣相顾尽沾衣，东望都门信马归。\n归来池苑皆依旧，太液芙蓉未央柳。\n芙蓉如面柳如眉，对此如何不泪垂。\n春风桃李花开夜，秋雨梧桐叶落时。\n西宫南苑多秋草，落叶满阶红不扫。\n梨园弟子白发新，椒房阿监青娥老。\n夕殿萤飞思悄然，孤灯挑尽未成眠。\n迟迟钟鼓初长夜，耿耿星河欲曙天。\n鸳鸯瓦冷霜华重，翡翠衾寒谁与共。\n悠悠生死别经年，魂魄不曾来入梦。\n临邛道士鸿都客，能以精诚致魂魄。\n为感君王辗转思，遂教方士殷勤觅。\n排空驭气奔如电，升天入地求之遍。\n上穷碧落下黄泉，两处茫茫皆不见。\n忽闻海上有仙山，山在虚无缥缈间。\n楼阁玲珑五云起，其中绰约多仙子。\n中有一人字太真，雪肤花貌参差是。\n金阙西厢叩玉扃，转教小玉报双成。\n闻道汉家天子使，九华帐里梦魂惊。\n揽衣推枕起徘徊，珠箔银屏迤逦开。\n云髻半偏新睡觉，花冠不整下堂来。\n风吹仙袂飘飖举，犹似霓裳羽衣舞。\n玉容寂寞泪阑干，梨花一枝春带雨。\n含情凝睇谢君王，一别音容两渺茫。\n昭阳殿里恩爱绝，蓬莱宫中日月长。\n回头下望人寰处，不见长安见尘雾。\n惟将旧物表深情，钿合金钗寄将去。\n钗留一股合一扇，钗擘黄金合分钿。\n但教心似金钿坚，天上人间会相见。\n临别殷勤重寄词，词中有誓两心知。\n七月七日长生殿，夜半无人私语时。\n在天愿作比翼鸟，在地愿为连理枝。\n天长地久有时尽，此恨绵绵无绝期。\n"},{"id":10,"href":"/en/post/chapter-4/","title":"Chapter IV: Master Jacques Coppenole","section":"Articles","content":"While the pensioner of Ghent and his eminence were exchanging very low bows and a few words in voices still lower, a man of lofty stature, with a large face and broad shoulders, presented himself, in order to enter abreast with Guillaume Rym; one would have pronounced him a bull-dog by the side of a fox. His felt doublet and leather jerkin made a spot on the velvet and silk which surrounded him. Presuming that he was some groom who had stolen in, the usher stopped him.\n“Hold, my friend, you cannot pass!”\nThe man in the leather jerkin shouldered him aside.\n“What does this knave want with me?” said he, in stentorian tones, which rendered the entire hall attentive to this strange colloquy. “Don’t you see that I am one of them?”\n“Your name?” demanded the usher.\n“Jacques Coppenole.”\n“Your titles?”\n“Hosier at the sign of the ‘Three Little Chains,’ of Ghent.”\nThe usher recoiled. One might bring one’s self to announce aldermen and burgomasters, but a hosier was too much. The cardinal was on thorns. All the people were staring and listening. For two days his eminence had been exerting his utmost efforts to lick these Flemish bears into shape, and to render them a little more presentable to the public, and this freak was startling. But Guillaume Rym, with his polished smile, approached the usher.\n“Announce Master Jacques Coppenole, clerk of the aldermen of the city of Ghent,” he whispered, very low.\n“Usher,” interposed the cardinal, aloud, “announce Master Jacques Coppenole, clerk of the aldermen of the illustrious city of Ghent.”\nThis was a mistake. Guillaume Rym alone might have conjured away the difficulty, but Coppenole had heard the cardinal.\n“No, cross of God?” he exclaimed, in his voice of thunder, “Jacques Coppenole, hosier. Do you hear, usher? Nothing more, nothing less. Cross of God! hosier; that’s fine enough. Monsieur the Archduke has more than once sought his gant* in my hose.”\n* Got the first idea of a timing.\nLaughter and applause burst forth. A jest is always understood in Paris, and, consequently, always applauded.\nLet us add that Coppenole was of the people, and that the auditors which surrounded him were also of the people.

His felt doublet and leather jerkin made a spot on the velvet and silk which surrounded him. Presuming that he was some groom who had stolen in, the usher stopped him.\n“Hold, my friend, you cannot pass!”\nThe man in the leather jerkin shouldered him aside.\n“What does this knave want with me?” said he, in stentorian tones, which rendered the entire hall attentive to this strange colloquy. “Don’t you see that I am one of them?”\n“Your name?” demanded the usher.\n“Jacques Coppenole.”\n“Your titles?”\n“Hosier at the sign of the ‘Three Little Chains,’ of Ghent.”\nThe usher recoiled. One might bring one’s self to announce aldermen and burgomasters, but a hosier was too much. The cardinal was on thorns. All the people were staring and listening. For two days his eminence had been exerting his utmost efforts to lick these Flemish bears into shape, and to render them a little more presentable to the public, and this freak was startling. But Guillaume Rym, with his polished smile, approached the usher.\n“Announce Master Jacques Coppenole, clerk of the aldermen of the city of Ghent,” he whispered, very low.\n“Usher,” interposed the cardinal, aloud, “announce Master Jacques Coppenole, clerk of the aldermen of the illustrious city of Ghent.”\nThis was a mistake. Guillaume Rym alone might have conjured away the difficulty, but Coppenole had heard the cardinal.\n“No, cross of God?” he exclaimed, in his voice of thunder, “Jacques Coppenole, hosier. Do you hear, usher? Nothing more, nothing less. Cross of God! hosier; that’s fine enough. Monsieur the Archduke has more than once sought his gant* in my hose.”\n* Got the first idea of a timing.\nLaughter and applause burst forth. A jest is always understood in Paris, and, consequently, always applauded.\nLet us add that Coppenole was of the people, and that the auditors which surrounded him were also of the people. Thus the communication between him and them had been prompt, electric, and, so to speak, on a level.

There was nothing notable in the event which thus set the bells and the bourgeois of Paris in a ferment from early morning. It was neither an assault by the Picards nor the Burgundians, nor a hunt led along in procession, nor a revolt of scholars in the town of Laas, nor an entry of “our much dread lord, monsieur the king,” nor even a pretty hanging of male and female thieves by the courts of Paris. Neither was it the arrival, so frequent in the fifteenth century, of some plumed and bedizened embassy. It was barely two days since the last cavalcade of that nature, that of the Flemish ambassadors charged with concluding the marriage between the dauphin and Marguerite of Flanders, had made its entry into Paris, to the great annoyance of M. le Cardinal de Bourbon, who, for the sake of pleasing the king, had been obliged to assume an amiable mien towards this whole rustic rabble of Flemish burgomasters, and to regale them at his Hôtel de Bourbon, with a very “pretty morality, allegorical satire, and farce,” while a driving rain drenched the magnificent tapestries at his door.\nWhat put the “whole population of Paris in commotion,” as Jehan de Troyes expresses it, on the sixth of January, was the double solemnity, united from time immemorial, of the Epiphany and the Feast of Fools.\nOn that day, there was to be a bonfire on the Place de Grève, a maypole at the Chapelle de Braque, and a mystery at the Palais de Justice. It had been cried, to the sound of the trumpet, the preceding evening at all the cross roads, by the provost’s men, clad in handsome, short, sleeveless coats of violet camelot, with large white crosses upon their breasts.\nSo the crowd of citizens, male and female, having closed their houses and shops, thronged from every direction, at early morn, towards some one of the three spots designated.\nEach had made his choice; one, the bonfire; another, the maypole; another, the mystery play. It must be stated, in honor of the good sense of the loungers of Paris, that the greater part of this crowd directed their steps towards the bonfire, which was quite in season, or towards the mystery play, which was to be presented in the grand hall of the Palais de Justice (the courts of law), which was well roofed and walled; and that the curious left the poor, scantily flowered maypole to shiver all alone beneath the sky of January, in the cemetery of the Chapel of Braque.\nThe populace thronged the avenues of the law courts in particular, because they knew that the Flemish ambassadors, who had arrived two days previously, intended to be present at the representation of the mystery, and at the election of the Pope of the Fools, which was also to take place in the grand hall.\nIt was no easy matter on that day, to force one’s way into that grand hall, although it was then reputed to be the largest covered enclosure in the world (it is true that Sauval had not yet measured the grand hall of the Château of Montargis). The palace place, encumbered with people, offered to the curious gazers at the windows the aspect of a sea; into which five or six streets, like so many mouths of rivers, discharged every moment fresh floods of heads. The waves of this crowd, augmented incessantly, dashed against the angles of the houses which projected here and there, like so many promontories, into the irregular basin of the place. In the centre of the lofty Gothic* façade of the palace, the grand staircase, incessantly ascended and descended by a double current, which, after parting on the intermediate landing-place, flowed in broad waves along its lateral slopes,—the grand staircase, I say, trickled incessantly into the place, like a cascade into a lake. The cries, the laughter, the trampling of those thousands of feet, produced a great noise and a great clamor. From time to time, this noise and clamor redoubled; the current which drove the crowd towards the grand staircase flowed backwards, became troubled, formed whirlpools. This was produced by the buffet of an archer, or the horse of one of the provost’s sergeants, which kicked to restore order; an admirable tradition which the provostship has bequeathed to the constablery, the constablery to the maréchaussée, the maréchaussée to our gendarmeri of Paris.\n"},{"id":18,"href":"/zh/post/chapter-1/","title":"Chapter I: The Grand Hall","section":"博文","content":"Three hundred and forty-eight years, six months, and nineteen days ago to-day, the Parisians awoke to the sound of all the bells in the triple circuit of the city, the university, and the town ringing a full peal.\nThe sixth of January, 1482, is not, however, a day of which history has preserved the memory.

It had been cried, to the sound of the trumpet, the preceding evening at all the cross roads, by the provost’s men, clad in handsome, short, sleeveless coats of violet camelot, with large white crosses upon their breasts.\nSo the crowd of citizens, male and female, having closed their houses and shops, thronged from every direction, at early morn, towards some one of the three spots designated.\nEach had made his choice; one, the bonfire; another, the maypole; another, the mystery play. It must be stated, in honor of the good sense of the loungers of Paris, that the greater part of this crowd directed their steps towards the bonfire, which was quite in season, or towards the mystery play, which was to be presented in the grand hall of the Palais de Justice (the courts of law), which was well roofed and walled; and that the curious left the poor, scantily flowered maypole to shiver all alone beneath the sky of January, in the cemetery of the Chapel of Braque.\nThe populace thronged the avenues of the law courts in particular, because they knew that the Flemish ambassadors, who had arrived two days previously, intended to be present at the representation of the mystery, and at the election of the Pope of the Fools, which was also to take place in the grand hall.\nIt was no easy matter on that day, to force one’s way into that grand hall, although it was then reputed to be the largest covered enclosure in the world (it is true that Sauval had not yet measured the grand hall of the Château of Montargis). The palace place, encumbered with people, offered to the curious gazers at the windows the aspect of a sea; into which five or six streets, like so many mouths of rivers, discharged every moment fresh floods of heads. The waves of this crowd, augmented incessantly, dashed against the angles of the houses which projected here and there, like so many promontories, into the irregular basin of the place. In the centre of the lofty Gothic* façade of the palace, the grand staircase, incessantly ascended and descended by a double current, which, after parting on the intermediate landing-place, flowed in broad waves along its lateral slopes,—the grand staircase, I say, trickled incessantly into the place, like a cascade into a lake. The cries, the laughter, the trampling of those thousands of feet, produced a great noise and a great clamor. From time to time, this noise and clamor redoubled; the current which drove the crowd towards the grand staircase flowed backwards, became troubled, formed whirlpools. This was produced by the buffet of an archer, or the horse of one of the provost’s sergeants, which kicked to restore order; an admirable tradition which the provostship has bequeathed to the constablery, the constablery to the maréchaussée, the maréchaussée to our gendarmeri of Paris.\n"},{"id":19,"href":"/docs/example/collapsed/3rd-level/chapter-1-copy/","title":"文章标题","section":"3rd Level","content":"内容内推\n离离原上草，一岁一枯荣。 野火烧不尽，春风吹又生。 远芳侵古道，晴翠接荒城。 又送王孙去，萋萋满别情。\n"},{"id":20,"href":"/en/post/","title":"Articles","section":"Ananke: a Hugo Theme","content":"Articles are paginated with only three posts here for example.

It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in Go templates.\nThis document is a brief primer on using Go templates. The Go docs provide more details.\nIntroduction to Go Templates #  Go templates provide an extremely simple template language. It adheres to the belief that only the most basic of logic belongs in the template or view layer. One consequence of this simplicity is that Go templates parse very quickly.\nA unique characteristic of Go templates is they are content aware. Variables and content will be sanitized depending on the context of where they are used. More details can be found in the Go docs.\nBasic Syntax #  Golang templates are HTML files with the addition of variables and functions.\nGo variables and functions are accessible within {{ }}\nAccessing a predefined variable \u0026ldquo;foo\u0026rdquo;:\n{{ foo }}  Parameters are separated using spaces\nCalling the add function with input of 1, 2:\n{{ add 1 2 }}  Methods and fields are accessed via dot notation\nAccessing the Page Parameter \u0026ldquo;bar\u0026rdquo;\n{{ .Params.bar }}  Parentheses can be used to group items together\n{{ if or (isset .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot;) (isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;) }} Caption {{ end }}  Variables #  Each Go template has a struct (object) made available to it. In hugo each template is passed either a page or a node struct depending on which type of page you are rendering. More details are available on the variables page.\nA variable is accessed by referencing the variable name.\n\u0026lt;title\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt;  Variables can also be defined and referenced.\n{{ $address := \u0026quot;123 Main St.\u0026quot;}} {{ $address }}  Functions #  Go template ship with a few functions which provide basic functionality. The Go template system also provides a mechanism for applications to extend the available functions with their own. Hugo template functions provide some additional functionality we believe are useful for building websites. Functions are called by using their name followed by the required parameters separated by spaces. Template functions cannot be added without recompiling hugo.\nExample:\n{{ add 1 2 }}  Includes #  When including another template you will pass to it the data it will be able to access. To pass along the current context please remember to include a trailing dot. The templates location will always be starting at the /layout/ directory within Hugo.\nExample:\n{{ template \u0026quot;chrome/header.html\u0026quot; . }}  Logic #  Go templates provide the most basic iteration and conditional logic.\nIteration #  Just like in Go, the Go templates make heavy use of range to iterate over a map, array or slice. The following are different examples of how to use range.\nExample 1: Using Context\n{{ range array }} {{ . }} {{ end }}  Example 2: Declaring value variable name\n{{range $element := array}} {{ $element }} {{ end }}  Example 2: Declaring key and value variable name\n{{range $index, $element := array}} {{ $index }} {{ $element }} {{ end }}  Conditionals #  If, else, with, or, \u0026amp; and provide the framework for handling conditional logic in Go Templates. Like range, each statement is closed with end.\nGo Templates treat the following values as false:\n false 0 any array, slice, map, or string of length zero  Example 1: If\n{{ if isset .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot; }}\u0026lt;h4\u0026gt;{{ index .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot; }}\u0026lt;/h4\u0026gt;{{ end }}  Example 2: If -\u0026gt; Else\n{{ if isset .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot; }} {{ index .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot; }} {{else}} {{ index .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot; }} {{ end }}  Example 3: And \u0026amp; Or\n{{ if and (or (isset .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot;) (isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;)) (isset .Params \u0026quot;attr\u0026quot;)}}  Example 4: With\nAn alternative way of writing \u0026ldquo;if\u0026rdquo; and then referencing the same value is to use \u0026ldquo;with\u0026rdquo; instead. With rebinds the context . within its scope, and skips the block if the variable is absent.\nThe first example above could be simplified as:\n{{ with .Params.title }}\u0026lt;h4\u0026gt;{{ . }}\u0026lt;/h4\u0026gt;{{ end }}  Example 5: If -\u0026gt; Else If\n{{ if isset .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot; }} {{ index .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot; }} {{ else if isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot; }} {{ index .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot; }} {{ end }}  Pipes #  One of the most powerful components of Go templates is the ability to stack actions one after another. This is done by using pipes. Borrowed from unix pipes, the concept is simple, each pipeline\u0026rsquo;s output becomes the input of the following pipe.\nBecause of the very simple syntax of Go templates, the pipe is essential to being able to chain together function calls. One limitation of the pipes is that they only can work with a single value and that value becomes the last parameter of the next pipeline.\nA few simple examples should help convey how to use the pipe.\nExample 1 :\n{{ if eq 1 1 }} Same {{ end }}  is the same as\n{{ eq 1 1 | if }} Same {{ end }}  It does look odd to place the if at the end, but it does provide a good illustration of how to use the pipes.\nExample 2 :\n{{ index .Params \u0026quot;disqus_url\u0026quot; | html }}  Access the page parameter called \u0026ldquo;disqus_url\u0026rdquo; and escape the HTML.\nExample 3 :\n{{ if or (or (isset .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot;) (isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;)) (isset .Params \u0026quot;attr\u0026quot;)}} Stuff Here {{ end }}  Could be rewritten as\n{{ isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot; | or isset .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot; | or isset .Params \u0026quot;attr\u0026quot; | if }} Stuff Here {{ end }}  Context (aka. the dot) #  The most easily overlooked concept to understand about Go templates is that {{ . }} always refers to the current context. In the top level of your template this will be the data set made available to it. Inside of a iteration it will have the value of the current item. When inside of a loop the context has changed. . will no longer refer to the data available to the entire page. If you need to access this from within the loop you will likely want to set it to a variable instead of depending on the context.\nExample:\n {{ $title := .Site.Title }} {{ range .Params.tags }} \u0026lt;li\u0026gt; \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;{{ $baseurl }}/tags/{{ . | urlize }}\u0026quot;\u0026gt;{{ . }}\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; - {{ $title }} \u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; {{ end }}  Notice how once we have entered the loop the value of {{ . }} has changed. We have defined a variable outside of the loop so we have access to it from within the loop.\nHugo Parameters #  Hugo provides the option of passing values to the template language through the site configuration (for sitewide values), or through the meta data of each specific piece of content. You can define any values of any type (supported by your front matter/config format) and use them however you want to inside of your templates.\nUsing Content (page) Parameters #  In each piece of content you can provide variables to be used by the templates. This happens in the front matter.\nAn example of this is used in this documentation site. Most of the pages benefit from having the table of contents provided. Sometimes the TOC just doesn\u0026rsquo;t make a lot of sense. We\u0026rsquo;ve defined a variable in our front matter of some pages to turn off the TOC from being displayed.\nHere is the example front matter:\n--- title: \u0026#34;Permalinks\u0026#34; date: \u0026#34;2013-11-18\u0026#34; aliases: - \u0026#34;/doc/permalinks/\u0026#34; groups: [\u0026#34;extras\u0026#34;] groups_weight: 30 notoc: true --- Here is the corresponding code inside of the template:\n {{ if not .Params.notoc }} \u0026lt;div id=\u0026quot;toc\u0026quot; class=\u0026quot;well col-md-4 col-sm-6\u0026quot;\u0026gt; {{ .TableOfContents }} \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; {{ end }}  Using Site (config) Parameters #  In your top-level configuration file (eg, config.yaml) you can define site parameters, which are values which will be available to you in chrome.\nFor instance, you might declare:\nparams:  CopyrightHTML: \u0026#34;Copyright \u0026amp;#xA9; 2013 John Doe. All Rights Reserved.\u0026#34;  TwitterUser: \u0026#34;spf13\u0026#34;  SidebarRecentLimit: 5 Within a footer layout, you might then declare a \u0026lt;footer\u0026gt; which is only provided if the CopyrightHTML parameter is provided, and if it is given, you would declare it to be HTML-safe, so that the HTML entity is not escaped again. This would let you easily update just your top-level config file each January 1st, instead of hunting through your templates.\n{{if .Site.Params.CopyrightHTML}}\u0026lt;footer\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;text-center\u0026#34;\u0026gt;{{.Site.Params.CopyrightHTML | safeHtml}}\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/footer\u0026gt;{{end}} An alternative way of writing the \u0026ldquo;if\u0026rdquo; and then referencing the same value is to use \u0026ldquo;with\u0026rdquo; instead. With rebinds the context . within its scope, and skips the block if the variable is absent:\n{{with .Site.Params.TwitterUser}}\u0026lt;span class=\u0026#34;twitter\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https://twitter.com/{{.}}\u0026#34; rel=\u0026#34;author\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;/images/twitter.png\u0026#34; width=\u0026#34;48\u0026#34; height=\u0026#34;48\u0026#34; title=\u0026#34;Twitter: {{.}}\u0026#34; alt=\u0026#34;Twitter\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;{{end}} Finally, if you want to pull \u0026ldquo;magic constants\u0026rdquo; out of your layouts, you can do so, such as in this example:\n\u0026lt;nav class=\u0026#34;recent\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Recent Posts\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;{{range first .Site.Params.SidebarRecentLimit .Site.Recent}} \u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;{{.RelPermalink}}\u0026#34;\u0026gt;{{.Title}}\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; {{end}}\u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/nav\u0026gt; "},{"id":23,"href":"/posts/hugoisforlovers/","title":"Getting Started with Hugo","section":"Blog","content":"Step 1.
